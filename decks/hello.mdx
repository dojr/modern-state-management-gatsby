# Modern State Management (with hooks)

## DJ Shamblin

---

## Hooks

- add state to functional components
- regular or custom hooks
- co locating code 
- replacing HOCs and reducing "wrapper hell"

---

## Four rules of hooks

- never call hooks from a loop
- never call hooks from a nested functional
- hooks always sit at the top level
- only call from a functional component

---

### npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks

---
### Component State rather than global state

- With redux all state is global and accessible to every component

- Add providers to only the components that need them

- Components outside that never use this state don't have access to it now

- Idea of co-locating state with the components that use it and avoid prop drilling at the same time
